# Battle of the Books Scorekeeper
A little while ago a coworker who is a youth librarian asked if I could make a tool that incorporated a timer, sound effects, and the ability to keep score for at least four teams because she couldn't find one tool that had all of these items and was instead relying on two sites to do everything. This led to another staff member being required to help her run the Battle of the Books because handling these duties in addition to a roomful of children was too much to do at once.

As a result, I created this tool, [which you can see here.](https://stevenremenapp.github.io/scorekeeper/) It allowed my coworker to run the Battle of the Books on her own, using her phone. It includes a state object to keep scorekeeping code DRY and session storage for the scores.
